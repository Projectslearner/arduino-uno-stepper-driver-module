# Stepper Motor Control with Acceleration using Arduino

## Description

This project demonstrates how to control a stepper motor with acceleration using an Arduino. Stepper motors are ideal for precise positioning tasks, and acceleration control allows for smoother and more controlled movements. The AccelStepper library is utilized to simplify stepper motor control and acceleration adjustment.

## Components Needed

1. **Arduino UNO**
2. **Stepper Motor**
3. **Driver Module (if required)**
4. **Jumper Wires**

## Circuit Wiring

1. **Stepper Motor:**
   - Connect the stepper motor's **step** pin to digital pin **3** on the Arduino.
   - Connect the stepper motor's **direction** pin to digital pin **2** on the Arduino.
   - If using a driver module, connect the required power and ground connections as per the module's specifications.

## Instructions

1. **Install the AccelStepper Library:**
   - Install the AccelStepper library in your Arduino IDE. You can do this by navigating to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...**, then searching for "AccelStepper" and installing it.

2. **Upload the Code:**
   - Copy and paste the provided code into the Arduino IDE.
   - Verify and upload the code to your Arduino board.

3. **Monitor the Output:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor to view the current speed, acceleration, and target position of the stepper motor.

## Project Operation

- **Initialization:**
  - The Arduino initializes serial communication at a baud rate of 9600.
  - Maximum speed and acceleration values for the stepper motor are set using the AccelStepper library functions.

- **Stepper Motor Control:**
  - The stepper motor continuously moves back and forth between two positions with varying speeds and acceleration.
  - Acceleration control ensures smooth and controlled movement, reducing the risk of motor stalling or overshooting.

## Applications

1. **CNC Machines:** Control the movement of axes in CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines.
2. **3D Printers:** Precisely control the movement of the print head or build platform.
3. **Camera Sliders:** Create motorized camera sliders for smooth and controlled camera movements.
